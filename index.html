                <p>I live in Media, Pennsylvania with my wife and six children. My family and I lived and did Christian work in Macedonia, Turkey, and Germany for 14 years and only returned to the States about 2 years ago.</p>
                <p>My background is in foreign languages and education. I speak French, German, Russian, Turkish, Macedonian, and Romani, and am currently learning Spanish. I love teaching foreign languages and English as a second language; I have taught several languages online to homeschoolers for 8 years now, and am finishing up my master's in TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language). My BA was in Russian and linguistics. Now I hope to combine a new interest in coding with language learning/teaching to create innovative language learning materials.</p>
